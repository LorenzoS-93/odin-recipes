# odin-recipes

The focus of the project is to become familiar with the basic function of the HTML "language"
We are asked to prove our knowledge over the use of images and hypertextual links, so to build a dummy website
In each page it is asked to use unorderd and ordered list, and title of appropriate size.
The last but not least of the objective is to give the student the freedom to choose the recipes so that he can not follow a common tutorial
